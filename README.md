# CS594-DCN-Final-Proj
Starter code for final project submissions in CS594: DCN

**NOTE: You can use the command `grip . <ip> &` where `<ip>` is the IP
of your CloudLab server to view the README.md files from your web
browser.**

## Part 0: Setup the cluster
Follow the steps in `env` (See the [README](env/README.md)).  If you
need to perform any additional environment configuration, you should add
scripts and documentation to this folder.

## Part 1: Create code for an experiment
You should put the *core code* you create as part of this project in
`code`.  The [README](code/README.md) in the `code` directory should
document the important files and directories of code and should describe
the steps needed to build the code, if needed.

## Part 2: Perform an experiment that benchmarks some aspect of your code
Any scripts and code created to run the *experiment* for your project
should be saved in the `exps` directory.  The [README](exps/README.md))
in this directory should detail the important files and folders for
running the experiments and provide step-by-step directions for running
the experiment.

## Part 3: Create a project writeup
Your writeup should be located in [writeup/WRITEUP.md](writeup/WRITEUP.md).
In this writeup, you will describe the design of your code and
experiments, and you will present and discuss the results of your
experiments.  This writeup should include any figures (PNG images) you
have created as part of your experiments.
